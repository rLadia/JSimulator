I'm using this project to experiment with C++ to Javascript translation using the Emscripten (https://github.com/kripken/emscripten) library and OpenGL web animations. 

The project uses Javascript to provide a graphical interface over an N-Body simulator developed in C++ (initially created for a class project and refined from there).
